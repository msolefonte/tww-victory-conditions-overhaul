Are you tired of the boring victory conditions of Total War: Warhammer II? Are you still trying to understand why do you need to have control of Naggaroth as Karak Azul? Do you feel that, after some turns, the game starts to feel like a painting game, where you just have to pass turns till you have control of all the map? Me too.

It is easy to hear that Mortal Empires campaigns are not finished: they are abandoned. Some people do not see a problem in this, as victory conditions are just a suggestion, proclaiming that "The game is a sandbox!" and you can "End it just when you get bored!". However, I like to keep my things done. This is why I did this mod.

Nowadays, as per version 1.9.1 of TW: Warhammer II, there are [b]54 playable factions[/b] along the multiple races. [b]This mod revisits them all[/b] (Yeah, it took its time). Stupid objectives like conquering capitals or destroy factions just for the sake of it have been removed. In their place, more loreful objectives have been added. However, do not try to see this is an absolute loreful project. Fun has been my main priority.

[h2]Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)[/h2]

There goes a list of Frequently Asked Questions. They take me a lot of time to answer, so I am not going to answer in the chat anything that is already here.


[h3]- Where can I check the changes?[/h3]

The list of changes is available in [url=https://github.com/msolefonte/tww2-victory-conditions-overhaul/]my personal GitHub[/url], where you can also take a look to the code to use it as an inspiration for your own projects. The list of factions is available [url=https://github.com/msolefonte/tww2-victory-conditions-overhaul/tree/master/src/factions]here[/url].

Note that each faction contains two files: [i]README.md[/i] and  [i]victory_conditions.txt[/i]. The first one is a human friendly text that reflex what is on the second one, but it is  [i]victory_conditions.txt[/i] what is finally truth and what is loaded by the script that generates the mod.

Also, you have a changelog available [url=https://github.com/msolefonte/tww2-victory-conditions-overhaul/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md]at GitHub[/url].

[h3]- Where can I report a bug?[/h3]

This mod should be compatible with anything that does not modify victory conditions and start positions. If, even knowing that, you are unable to make it work or you found that something is not working as it should, feel free to contact me at the mod page or to open [url=https://github.com/msolefonte/tww2-victory-conditions-overhaul/issues]an issue at GitHub[/url].

[h3]- Can I propose a change?[/h3]

Of course! It is really hard to keep fun 54 factions. I myself have not played them all, so any help is welcome and any suggestion will be heard. Some things are not possible, or are too complex to do and maintain, but do not be scared of reporting any think that you would like to see.

To propose a change, please create or join a discussion titled "[FACTION NAME] Victory Conditions [Main Discussion]"

[h3]- Do Achievements still work?[/h3]

Yes, they do.

[h3]- Does this also modify [INSERT VANILLA FACTION]?[/h3]

This mod revisits all the Vanilla factions. Some are better, some still need some work, but every faction in the Vanilla game is included in the overhaul.

[h3]- Does this mod also modifies Co-Op / Head To Head Victory Conditions?[/h3]

Nope. They are kept the same than in vanilla. I know a lot of people will be happy with that addition, but I am not a player of them, so I am not going to spend weeks working in something I am not going to use.

[h3]- Is this compatible with X mod?[/h3]

[b]This is compatible with everything that does not modify Starting Positions, Adds Factions or Victory Conditions[/b]. As far as I know. Victory Conditions and Available Factions are stored in the same file, so one mod overrides the other. This is why I can not add new victory conditions to unlocked factions, as changes override themselves.

I am going to work to add more compatibilities, but it is not a priority right now. I understand that everyone wants to use this together with Crynsos Faction Unlocker+ or Mixu's Unlocker, but that would require to update their mods and to have second versions that include this one, which is a pita for us the developers. I hope you understand it!
