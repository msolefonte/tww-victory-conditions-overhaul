## Warriors of Chaos

### Warriors of Chaos

* **Short Victory Conditions**:
	* Raze or sack 50 regions
	* Destroy the Empire, Bretonnia, Dwarfs and High Elves
* **Long Victory Conditions**:
	* Raze or sack 80 regions
	* Destroy the Empire, Bretonnia, Dwarfs and High Elves

_NOTE:_ The short objective should be raze Fallen Gates, Middenheim, Shrine of Asuryan and The Frozen City, but it is 
bugged, so for now it is going to be the same than the long one.
